made by coolfav on Github
Requirements if you want to use this source code for your own bot:

-Any python IDE

-Discord.py[voice]

-Youtube-dl

Instructions:

1. Change all of the directory locations in the code to the directory where you placed the files you downloaded
2. Replace the "token" at the bottom of mainbot.py with the token of your discord bot (you can make one at https://discord.com/developers/applications)
3. Run the python file
4. As long as your file is running, the bot should work as intended (as long as there aren't any bugs)
